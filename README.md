## About RLC
The first Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) will be held in Amherst, Massachusetts from August 9â€“12, 2024. RLC is an annual international conference focusing on reinforcement learning. RLC provides an archival venue where reinforcement learning researchers can interact and share their research in a more focused setting than typical large machine learning venues. The RLC peer review process prioritizes rigorous methodology over perceived importance, aiming to foster scholarly discussions on both well\-established and emerging topics in RL.


We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including, but not limited to:

* RL algorithms (e.g., new algorithms for existing settings and new settings)
* Hierarchical RL (e.g., skill discovery, hierarchical representations and abstractions)
* Exploration (e.g., intrinsic motivation, curiosity\-driven learning, exploration\-exploitation tradeoff)
* Theoretical RL (e.g., complexity results, convergence analysis)
* Social and economic aspects  (e.g., safety, fairness, interpretability, privacy, trustworthiness, human\-AI interaction, philosophy)
* Bandit algorithms (e.g., theoretical contributions, practical algorithms)
* Planning algorithms (e.g., decision\-making under uncertainty, model\-based approaches) 
* Foundations (e.g., showing relationships between methods, unifying theory, clarifying misconceptions in the literature)
* Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability, and validity)
* Applied reinforcement learning (e.g., medical, operations, traffic)
* Deep reinforcement learning (e.g., analysis on the interplay between RL and deep learning models)
* Multi\-agent RL (e.g., cooperative, competitive, self\-play, etc)
* Multidisciplinary work (RL research that relates to other fields)
* RL Systems (e.g., distributed training, multi\-GPU training)

We also welcome interdisciplinary research that does not fit neatly into existing categories, but which falls under the broad scope of reinforcement learning research.
