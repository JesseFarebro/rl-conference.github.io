A few words of warning while I fix up the site.

1. When you run make freeze it moves things to build. You then need to copy this over to docs because
the site builds off the docs folder. 

2. You need to copy the CNAME into the docs folder.

3. The blog post stuff doesn't work AT ALL. It's being constructed by hand!!!! AHHH! 
In particular, the markdown -> html messes up lists and for some reason embeds the links to the blog posts
as downloads instead of links. So you have to go to the actual page and fix the linking for each blog post.
