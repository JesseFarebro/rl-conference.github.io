A few words of warning while I fix up the site.

1. When you run make freeze it moves things to build. You then need to copy this over to docs because
the site builds off the docs folder. 

2. You need to copy the CNAME into the docs folder.

3. If you don't want the site preview to be Amy's face, go to the index.html
file in docs after building and add these lines between the <head> </head>
